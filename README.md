# Sqlalchemy-Challenge
This Climate Analysis API provides a series of endpoints to access historical weather data from the Hawaii climate database. The API is built using Flask and SQLAlchemy, making it easy to retrieve information on precipitation, station data, and temperature observations.

## Features

- Retrieve last 12 months of precipitation data.
- List all weather stations.
- Fetch temperature observations of the most active station for the last year.
- Calculate temperature statistics (min, max, avg) for a given date range.
